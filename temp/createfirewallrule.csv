Key,Description
type,"Set a firewall rule type (pass,ÿblock,ÿreject)"
interface,"Set which interface the rule will apply to. You may specify either the interface?s descriptive name, the pfSense ID (wan, lan, optx), or the physical interface id (e.g. igb0). Floating rules are not supported."
ipprotocol,"Set which IP protocol(s) the rule will apply to (inet,ÿinet6,ÿinet46)"
protocol,"Set which transfer protocol the rule will apply to. Ifÿtcp,ÿudp,ÿtcp/udp, you must define a source and destination port"
icmptype,"Set the ICMP subtype of the firewall rule. Multiple values may be passed in as array, single values may be passed as string.ÿOnly available whenÿprotocolÿis set toÿicmp. Ifÿicmptypeÿis not specified all subtypes are assumed"
src,"Set the source address of the firewall rule. This may be a single IP, network CIDR, alias name, or interface. When specifying an interface, you may use the physical interface ID, the descriptive interfance name, or the pfSense ID. To use only interface address, addÿipÿto the end of the interface name otherwise the entire interface?s subnet is implied. To negate the context of the source address, you may prepend the address withÿ!"
dst,"Set the destination address of the firewall rule. This may be a single IP, network CIDR, alias name, or interface. When specifying an interface, you may use the physical interface ID, the descriptive interface name, or the pfSense ID. To only use interface address, addÿipÿto the end of the interface name otherwise the entire interface?s subnet is implied. To negate the context of the source address, you may prepend the address withÿ!"
srcport,"Set the TCP and/or UDP source port or port alias of the firewall rule. This is only necessary if you have specified theÿprotocolÿtoÿtcp,ÿudp,ÿtcp/udp"
dstport,"Set the TCP and/or UDP destination port or port alias of the firewall rule. This is only necessary if you have specified theÿprotocolÿtoÿtcp,ÿudp,ÿtcp/udp"
gateway,Set the routing gateway traffic will take upon match (optional)
disabled,Disable the rule upon creation (optional)
descr,Set a description for the rule (optional)
log,Enabling rule matche logging (optional)
top,Add firewall rule to top of access control list (optional)
